#I wanted to combine my payment made into one table (dataframe)
#Instead of reading them in manually one at a time..
#...I downloaded the files from my accoutn in the .csv format.
#Using Jupyter notebooks, I needed to place the files in the current working directory so Python can fine them.

#First, in the console line type the following:

pwd

#..then press the 'Shift'  and 'Enter' buttons
#The directory path will return the root (working) directory of Python.
#Mine looked like this..  C:\\Users\\my_user_name'

#This is how I knew where to save my .csv files 

# Next, I typed the following code below:


import pandas as pd
df = pd.concat(map(pd.read_csv, ['january.csv', 'february.csv']))
df

#Press the 'Run' button on the notebook menu and you will see a nice combined table of your files.
#Note, both files need to have the same structure. i.e same column names.
#Since I downloaded both files from the same account, I didn't have to worry about further manipulation.
